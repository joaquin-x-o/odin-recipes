Recipe web page focused on the use of HTML

On this project, I will create a basic recipe website. This will contain a main page linking to three recipes. Each recipe will have its own webpage that will be linked on the main page.

The focus is on practicing and using the basic HTML tools. Creating commit messages is also a relevant task on this project.
