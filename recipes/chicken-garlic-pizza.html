                <li>2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onion</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
                <li>1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust dough</li>
                <li>2 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced</li>
                <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
                <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken breast in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until no longer pink, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool slightly, then cut into strips.</li>
                <li>In a small skillet over medium heat, melt butter with garlic, onion, and basil. Pour into a chilled dish to cool, and refrigerate until set.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Roll out pizza dough, place onto a pizza pan or other baking sheet, and spread herb butter over surface using the back of a spoon. Arrange chicken on top, then dot with ricotta cheese. Top with tomato slices, cilantro, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is browned and the center is cooked through.</li>
            </ol>
